## Goal
Predict the manner of exercise performance (variable `classe`) using sensor data.

## Data
Data source: Coursera provided `pml-training.csv` and `pml-testing.csv`.

## Load Libraries and Data
```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(dplyr)
set.seed(123)

# Load datasets
train <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings = c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
test  <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", na.strings = c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

# Display dataset dimensions and sample
dim(train)
head(train[, 1:5])
